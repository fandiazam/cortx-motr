/**
   @defgroup desim Discrete Event Simulator

   <b>Concepts</b>

   sim is a very simple discrete event simulator, geared toward simulation of
   distributed systems.

   In sim a model consists of state machines, representing entities in a system
   being simulated. Software (a client cache, a kernel disc elevator, a thread
   etc.) as well as hardware (a volatile memory, a hard disc, a network, etc.)
   entities can be simulated.

   A state machine maintains some internal state, receives input events, and
   sends output messages to state machines. The core task of simulator is to
   arrange events in the chronological order, given that state transitions and
   event deliveries take some time, specified by the model. While for some
   system message exchanging state machines are a natural device of simulation,
   the most common control flow mechanism---a function call is awkward to
   express this way. sim provides a built-in support for synchronous state
   machine interaction.

   <b>Data types and interfaces</b>

   The most fundamental components of sim are logical time (struct sim) and a
   future event (struct sim_callout), defined in sim.h.

   struct sim represents an instance of simulation, it contains a current
   logical time (sim::ss_bolt) and a queue of future events
   (sim::ss_future). sim_run() function executes main simulation loop: it
   removes an event from head of the future events list and calls its callback
   function repeatedly until the future queue is empty. Callback functions
   populate the queue by creating new future events (by calling
   sim_timer_add()), that are added to the queue in chronological order.

   struct sim_callout represents a parametrized event scheduled for some future
   time ("callout" is a traditional UNIX name for this).

   Sequential threads are simulated with two more data types:

   struct sim_thread represents a simulated thread. struct sim_chan represents a
   channel (in UNIX kernel sense) that threads can synchronize on. sim_thread is
   relatively lightweight. Current implementation is based on ucontext_t calls
   (getcontext(3), swapcontext(3), etc.). Overhead depends on platform. Mac OS X
   requires a minimum stack of 32K (16K on Linux).

   Threading introduces two distinct modes of execution: in-thread and call-back
   (the latter is also called a "scheduler mode"). Call-back is a code executed
   on the stack of main simulation loop. All timer code runs in call-backs. Mode
   of execution can be distinguished by result of sim_thread_current() function
   which is non-null only in a thread. New threads can be created only from
   call-backs.

   A "counter" is a simple statistical and measurement interface. A counter
   (struct cnt) is named on creation. A "measurement" can be added to a counter
   by a call to cnt_mod(). When simulation finishes, values of all alive
   counters are dumped onto standard output. A counter reports average and
   standard deviation (a square root of difference between average of squared
   measurements and squared average). A counter optionally has a parent counter
   to which it replicates all its measurements. This can be used to accumulate
   data across a number of short-lived objects (like RPCs). Histogram
   capabilities should be added.

   @todo add m0_ prefixes to sim symbols.

/**
 * A thread in a simulated world.
 *
 * Conceptually, a thread can always be replaced by a collection of call-outs. A
 * thread is advantageous and natural to use when there is a lot of state to be
 * maintained between call-outs and this state cannot be readily stored in some
 * data-structure hanging off sim_callout::sc_datum. A thread uses native C
 * language stack to store the state.
 *
 * Threads interact with the simulation by sleeping (sim_sleep()), waiting on
 * channels (struct sim_chan) and posting call-outs.
 *
 * Current thread uses ucontext functions to implement lightweight and simple
 * user-level threads. Blocking system call made from a sim_thread blocks the
 * whole simulation.
 *
 * With threads there are two modes in which simulation can be at the moment:
 *
 *     "thread mode", when one of the threads is running. In this mode the code
 *     is executed on the thread's stack;
 *
 *     "scheduler mode", when no thread is running and simulation state is
 *     advanced by main simulation loop running on a stack where sim_run() was
 *     called, executing call-outs.
 *
 * Note that this distinction is similar to "process" vs. "interrupt" modes of a
 * traditional UNIX kernel.
 *
 * A switch from thread to scheduler mode occurs when a thread is suspended
 * (e.g., to wait on a channel) or exits. A switch in the opposite direction
 * happens when a thread is resumed (e.g., woken up or starts for the first
 * time).
