/**
 * @defgroup rm-ha HA notifications support in RM.
 *
 * Local RM owners communicate with remote RM owners operating in context of RM
 * service located on remote network node. HA can make decision about RM service
 * failure and notify all nodes about it. Locally, acceptance of such
 * notification means HA state change of corresponding configuration object in
 * confc instance to M0_NC_FAILED. Also, HA can make decision that RM service is
 * recovered froom failure and is online again. Local RM owners should track
 * these HA state changes and take appropriate actions on them.
 *
 * Local RM owners create a subscription to HA notifications about remote RM
 * services. Effectively, subscription means attaching clink to corresponding RM
 * service configuration object channel (m0_conf_obj::co_chan). Subscription can
 * be made synchronously through m0_rm_ha_subscribe_sync() function, or
 * asynchronously using m0_rm_ha_subscriber structure and related functions.
 * RM service configuration object is searched by user-provided remote endpoint
 * in user-provided confc instance.
 *
 * There are two types of remote owners in relation to local owners: debtors and
 * creditors. They have different subscription policies.
 *
 * Subscription to debtor's HA state change is created when the first request
 * from the remote is received (@see rfom_debtor_subscribe()). RPC endpoint is
 * extracted from RPC connection. This subscription is done automatically inside
 * RM code. Result of subscription doesn't affect overall result of incoming
 * request processing.
 *
 * Subscription to creditor's HA state change isn't created automatically by RM
 * code. The reason is that creditor remote structure initialised and managed
 * by RM user and provided to m0_rm_owner_init(). So RM user should create
 * subscription manually. Not all users are interested in tracking creditor
 * failures (assume short-lived local owner that is created to make a few credit
 * requests). Also, confc can be not ready at the point of local RM owner
 * creation (for example, rconfc requests read lock when confc is not ready
 * yet). If local RM owner observes creditor failure notified by HA, then it
 * invokes "self-windup" procedure ending up in ROS_DEAD_CREDITOR or
 * ROS_INSOLVENT state. The reason for such behaviour is that RM owner can't
 * functioning properly without creditor. RM user can detect that fact by
 * monitoring owner state and react properly. For example, switch to another
 * creditor using m0_rm_owner_creditor_reset(). Also local RM owner can recover
 * from ROS_DEAD_CREDITOR back to ROS_ACTIVE if HA state of creditor returns
 * back to M0_NC_ONLINE.
 *
 * Concrete actions taken upon remote owner HA state changes are implemented in
 * rm_remote_death_ast()/rm_remote_online_ast() functions.
 *
 * @note Several remote RM owners can co-exist in one remote RM service. In this
 * case several subscriptions (by the number of owners) will be created instead
 * of one. It's a little overhead, but it eases implementation.
