A set of RPC benchmarks measures data needed for the following plots:

  - rate (in messages per second) vs. number of connections;
  - rate vs. message length (in bytes);
  - processor utilisation vs. number of connections.

*Note*: It is important to push along X axis (possibly
logarithmically) until the peak is found.

*Note*: Expected number of connections per rpc machine --- up to tens
of millions.

                          +--------------+
     num. of connections  |              |
