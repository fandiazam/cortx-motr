/**
   Formation component for Motr RPC layer is what IO scheduler is for
   block device. Because of network layer overhead associated with each
   message (i.e. buffer), sending each individual RPC item directly to network
   layer can be inefficient. Instead, formation component tries to send
   multiple RPC items in same network layer message to improve performance.

   RPC items that are posted to RPC layer for sending are enqueued in formation
   queue. Formation then prepares "RPC Packets". A RPC Packet is collection
   of RPC items that are sent together in same network layer buffer.

   To improve performance formation component does two things:

   - Batching:
     Formation batches multiple RPC items - that are targeted to same
     destination end-point - in RPC packets.

   - Merging:
     If there are any two items A and B such that they can be merged into
     _one_ item then Formation tries to merge these items and add this
     aggregate RPC item to the packet. How the "contents" of RPC items A and B
     are merged together is dependent on _item type_ of A and B. Formation
     is not aware about how these items are merged.

   While forming RPC packets Formation has to obey several "constraints":
   - max_packet_size:
   - max_nr_bytes_accumulated:
   - max_nr_segments
   - max_nr_packets_enqed
   @see m0_rpc_frm_constraints for more information.

   It is important to note that Formation has something to do only on
   "outgoing path".

   NOTE:
   - RPC Packet is also referred as "RPC" in some other parts of code and docs
   - A "one-way" item is also referred as "unsolicited" item.

   @todo XXX Support for "RPC Group"
   @todo XXX RPC item cancellation
   @todo XXX Better RPC level flow control than the one provided by
             m0_rpc_frm_constraints::fc_max_nr_packets_enqed
