/**
 * @defgroup rpc-at
 *
 * RPC adaptive transmission (AT) is an interface to send/receive buffers as a
 * part of RPC item. AT implementation transfers the contents of the buffer to
 * the receiver either:
 * - inline, i.e., by including the contents of the buffer into the RPC item
 *   body, or
 * - inbulk, by constructing a network buffer representing the memory buffer,
 *   transmitting the network buffer descriptor in the RPC item and using bulk
 *   (RDMA) to transfer the contents of the buffer.
 * Implementation hides actual transfer method from RPC parties as much as
 * possible.
 *
 * Two roles are clearly distinguished:
 * - client, the originator of buffer transmission via RPC AT mechanism. Client
 *   can issue two types of requests: send buffer to server and request buffer
 *   from server.
 * - server, which handles client requests. Server-side AT interface is
 *   fom-oriented.
 *
 * Client to server buffer transmission
 * ------------------------------------
 *
 * Client is able to attach m0_buf buffer (exactly one) to an RPC AT buffer
 * (m0_rpc_at_buf). After that RPC AT buffer can be sent as part of RPC item.
 * Actual buffer transfer method depends on:
 * - buffer alignment. Only page-aligned buffers are suitable for inbulk.
 * - buffer size. Every RPC machine has a parameter that determines the cutoff
 *   size after which inbulk is used.
 *
 * Client code to initialise AT buffer:
 * @code
 * m0_rpc_at_init(ab);
 * rc = m0_rpc_at_add(ab, user_buf, rpc_mach);
 * if (rc == 0)
 *         // Send RPC item containing ab.
 *         m0_rpc_post_sync(fop, ...);
 * m0_rpc_at_fini(ab);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note, that AT buffer finalisation should be done after reply from server is
 * received.
 *
 * Server code to load AT buffer received in RPC item:
 * @code
 * foo_tick(fom) {
 *         switch (fom_phase(fom)) {
 *         ...
 *         case PHASE_X:
 *                 ...
 *                 return m0_rpc_at_load(&fop->ab, fom, PHASE_Y);
 *         case PHASE_Y:
 *                 struct m0_buf buf;
 *
 *                 rc = m0_rpc_at_get(&fop->ab, &buf);
 *                 // Process buf.
 *                 ...
 *                 m0_rpc_at_fini(&fop->ab);
 *         }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note, that initialisation of AT buffer is not required.
 *
 *
 * Buffer reception from server
 * ----------------------------
 *
 * Client is able to request buffer from server by sending AT buffer of special
 * type as part of RPC request. Identification of requested buffer on server
 * side is specific to RPC item type. Server sends requested buffer by embedding
 * AT buffer as part of reply RPC item.
 *
 * Client specifies in request the preferred way of buffer transmission: inline
 * or inbulk. For inbulk transmission client allocates incoming net buffer of
 * sufficient size and sends its descriptor in request. Client uses empty buffer
 * (of type M0_RPC_AT_EMPTY) to specify that inline transmission is preferred.
 *
 * Server chooses the way of buffer transmission using the following algorithm:
 * - If inline is requested and is possible (buffer is not too big), than inline
 *   is used.
 * - If inbulk is requested and received net buffer descriptor has sufficient
 *   size, then inbulk is used. AT buffer in reply contains status of RPC bulk
 *   transmission and requested buffer length.
 * - If inbulk is required, but client requested inline or inbulk with
 *   insufficient size, then AT buffer in server reply contains error code and
 *   size of the buffer. Client can use this information to re-request buffer
 *   using inbulk with sufficient size of net buffer.
 *
 * @todo Another method of buffer transmission may be needed: "best". When
 * client specifies this method it has to provide network buffer as with in-bulk
 * case. The server sends the reply inline if possible, uses the netbuffer
 * otherwise. This would allow return of large records (via in-bulk), while
 * avoiding in-bulk overhead for small records.
 *
 * Client code example:
 * @code
 * int buf_request(uint32_t len, bool force, struct m0_buf *out, bool *rep_bulk)
 * {
 *         // Initialise RPC item.
 *         ...
 *         m0_rpc_at_init(ab);
 *         rc = m0_rpc_at_recv(ab, rmach, len, force);
 *         if (rc == 0) {
 *                 rc = m0_rpc_post_sync(fop, ...);
 *                 if (rc == 0) {
 *                         // rep_ab is a pointer to AT buffer in RPC reply.
 *                         ...
 *                         rc = m0_rpc_at_rep_get(ab, rep_ab, out);
 *                         if (rc != 0)
 *                                 *rep_bulk = m0_rpc_at_rep_is_bulk(rep_ab,
 *                                                               &out.b_nob);
 *                 }
 *         }
 *         m0_rpc_at_fini(ab);
 *         // Finalise RPC item.
 *         ...
 *         return rc;
 * }
 *
 * rep_bulk = false;
 * // Assume client doesn't have any idea about buffer size.
 * rc = buf_request(M0_RPC_AT_UNKNOWN_LEN, false, &buf, &rep_bulk);
 * if (rc != 0 && rep_bulk) {
 *         // Re-request buffer, now forcing bulk.
 *         len = buf->b.nob;
 *         buf = M0_BUF_INIT0;
 *         rc = buf_request(len, true, &buf, &rep_bulk);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Server code example:
 * @code
 * foo_tick(fom) {
 *         switch (fom_phase(fom)) {
 *         ...
 *         case PHASE_X:
 *                 ...
 *                 m0_rpc_at_init(&fom->fo_rep_fop->rep_ab);
 *                 return m0_rpc_at_reply(&fom->fo_fop->ab,
 *                                        &fom->fo_rep_fop->rep_ab,
 *                                        buf, fom, PHASE_Y);
 *         case PHASE_Y:
 *                 // Check status. At this point requested buffer is
 *                 // inlined at reply FOP or sent via RPC bulk to client.
 *                 rc = m0_rpc_at_reply_rc(&fom->fo_rep_fop->rep_ab);
 *         }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note, that server shouldn't finalise RPC AT buffer that is used as the reply
 * to the client request. The memory will be automatically de-allocated when
 * a corresponding reply FOP is finalised.
 *
 * Forcing RPC bulk method on client side is required in case if maximum RPC
 * item size or inbulk threshold are configured differently on server and
 * client. For example, client may have higher inbulk threshold and would prefer
 * to use inline reception method, but server will return an error because of
 * lower inbulk threshold.
 *
 * @todo: Perform negotiation on inbulk threshold during connection
 * establishment?
