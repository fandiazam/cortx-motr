   @defgroup net_buffer_pool Network Buffer Pool
   @ingroup net

   @brief Network buffer pool allocates and manages a pool of network buffers.
	  Users request a buffer from the pool and after its usage is over
	  gives back to the pool.

	  It provides support for a pool of network buffers involving no higher
	  level interfaces than the network module itself.
	  It is associated with a single network domain.
	  Non-blocking interfaces are available to get and put network buffers.
	  Call-backs are provided to announce when the pool is non-empty or
	  low on free buffers.

	  Upon receiving the not_empty call back user can put back buffers which
	  are not in use into the pool.

	  The "coloured" variant of the get operation is done by returning the
	  most recently used buffer that is associated with a specific colour
	  (transfer machine), or if none such are found, the least recently
	  used buffer from the pool, if any.

	  Pool is protected by a lock, to get or put a buffer into the pool user
	  must acquire the lock and release the lock once its usage is over.

	  To finalize the pool all the buffers must be returned back to the pool
	  (i.e number of free buffers must be equal to the total number of
	   buffers).

 To describe a typical buffer pool usage pattern, suppose that one wants
 a buffer pool of 10, size of each segment is 1024, number of segments is
 64 and threshold is 10.

    First, user needs to provide m0_net_buffer_pool_ops:
    @code
	struct m0_net_buffer_pool_ops b_ops = {
		.nbpo_not_empty       = notempty,
		.nbpo_below_threshold = low,
	};
    @endcode

   - Then, buffer pool needs to be assigned to a network domain and initialized
	with above values:
    @code
	struct m0_net_buffer_pool bp;
	struct m0_net_xprt *xprt;
	...
	bp.nbp_ops = &b_ops;
	rc = m0_net_buffer_pool_init(&bp, bp.nbp_ndom, 10, 64, 4096, 10, ...);
	...
    @endcode

   - Now, to add buffers into the pool need to acquire the lock and then specify
	the number of buffers to be added:
    @code
	m0_net_buffer_pool_lock(&bp);
	m0_net_buffer_pool_provision(&bp, 10);
	m0_net_buffer_pool_unlock(&bp);
    @endcode

    - To add a buffer in the pool:
    @code
	m0_net_buffer_pool_lock(&bp);
	m0_net_buffer_pool_provision(&bp, 1);
	m0_net_buffer_pool_unlock(&bp);
    @endcode

    - To get a buffer from the pool:
	To use any colour for the buffer variable colour should be
	M0_BUFFER_ANY_COLOUR.
    @code
	m0_net_buffer_pool_lock(&bp);
	nb = m0_net_buffer_pool_get(&bp, colour);
	if (nb != NULL)
		"Use the buffer"
	else
		"goto sleep until buffer is available"
	m0_net_buffer_pool_unlock(&bp);
    @endcode

   - To put back the buffer in the pool:
	To use any colour for the buffer variable colour should be
	M0_BUFFER_ANY_COLOUR.
    @code
	m0_net_buffer_pool_lock(&bp);
	m0_net_buffer_pool_put(&bp, nb, colour);
	m0_net_buffer_pool_unlock(&bp);
    @endcode

    - To remove a buffer from the pool:
    @code
	m0_net_buffer_pool_lock(&bp);
	m0_net_buffer_pool_prune(&bp);
	m0_net_buffer_pool_unlock(&bp);
    @endcode

    - To finalize the pool:
    @code
	m0_net_buffer_pool_fini(&bp);
    @endcode
