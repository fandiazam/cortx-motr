   @addtogroup bulkmem

   This transport can be used directly for testing purposes.  It permits the
   creation of multiple domains, each with multiple transfer machines, and
   provides support for message passing and bulk data transfer between transfer
   machines of different domains.  Data is copied between buffers.

   It uses a pool of background threads per transfer machine to provide the
   required threading semantics of the messaging API and the illusion of
   independent domains.

   It can also serve as a "base" module for derived transports that wish
   to reuse the threading and buffer management support of this module.
   Derivation is done as follows:
   - Define derived versions of data structures as required,
     with the corresponding base data structure embedded within.
   - Override the xo_ domain operations and reuse those that apply - in some
     cases the base xo_ routines can be called from their derived versions.
     The following must be replaced:
        - xo_dom_init()
	- xo_buf_add()
	- xo_end_point_create()

   - The derived xo_dom_init() subroutine should allocate the private domain
     structure, set the value in the nd_xprt_private field, and then call the
     base domain initialization subroutine.
     On return, adjust the following:
        - Size values in the base domain private structure
	- The number of threads in a transfer machine pool
	- Worker functions, especially for the following opcodes:
          M0_NET_XOP_STATE_CHANGE, M0_NET_XOP_MSG_SEND, M0_NET_XOP_ACTIVE_BULK.
          New worker functions can invoke the base worker functions if
          desired.

   - The xo_buf_add() subroutine must do what it takes to prepare a buffer
     for an operation.  This is domain specific.  The base
     version of the subroutine can be called to handle the queuing.

   - The xo_end_point_create() subroutine must do what it takes to create
     a domain specific end point. The base subroutine may be used if there
     is value in its parsing of IP address and port number; it is capable of
     allocating sufficient space in the end point data structure for the
     derived transport.

   See @ref LNetDFS for an example of a derived transport.
