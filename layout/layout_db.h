 * the layout entries created and used.
 *
 * This section describes the data structures exposed and the external
 * interfaces of the Layout DB module and it briefly identifies the users of
 * these interfaces so as to explain how to use this module.

 * A file layout is used by the client to perform IO against that file. For
 * example, layout for a file may contain COB identifiers for all the COBs
 * associated with that file. For example, the COB identifiers may be stored
 * by the layout either in the form of a list or as a linear formula.
 *
 * Example use case of reading a file:
 * - Reading a file involves reading basic file attributes from the basic file
 *   attributes table).
 * - The layout id is obtained from the basic file attributes.
 * - A query is sent to the Layout module to obtain layout for this layout id
 *   using the API m0_layout_lookup()
 *   - m0_layout_lookup() returns the layout object if it is cached.
 *   - If the layout is not cached, m0_layout_lookup() return it by reading
 *     it from the layout DB and by keeping it in the cache.
 * - Reading a layout record from the layout DB involves the following for
 *   example:
 *    - If the layout record is with the LINEAR enumeration, then the
 *      linear formula is obtained from the DB. Once the formula is available,
 *      the user can substitute the required parameters into the formula so as
 *      to obtain the list of COB identifiers to operate upon.
 *    - If the layout record is with the LIST enumeration, then the
 *      the list of COB identifiers is obtained from the layout DB itself.
 *    - If the layout record is of the COMPOSITE layout type, it means it
 *      constitutes of multiple sub-layouts. In this case, the sub-layouts are
 *      read from the layout DB. Those sub-layout records in turn could be of
 *      other layout types and with LINEAR or LIST enumeration for example.
 *      The sub-layout records are then read accordingly until the time the
 *      final list of all the COB identifiers is obtained.
