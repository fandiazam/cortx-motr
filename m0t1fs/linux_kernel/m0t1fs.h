  @defgroup m0t1fs m0t1fs

  @section Overview

  m0t1fs is a motr client file-system for linux. It is implemented as a
  kernel module.

  @section m0t1fsfuncspec Function Specification

  m0t1fs has flat file-system structure i.e. no directories except root.
  m0t1fs does not support caching. All read-write requests are directly
  forwarded to servers.

  By default m0t1fs uses end-point address 0@lo:12345:45:6 as its local
  address. This address can be changed with local_addr module parameter.
  e.g. to make m0t1fs use 172.18.50.40@o2ib1:12345:34:1 as its end-point address
  load module with command:

  sudo insmod m0tr.ko local_addr="172.18.50.40@o2ib1:12345:34:1"

  m0t1fs can be mounted with mount command:

  mount -t m0t1fs -o <options_list> dontcare <dir_name>

  where <options_list> is a comma separated list of option=value elements.
  Currently supported list of options is:

  - confd [value type: end-point address, e.g. 192.168.50.40@tcp:12345:34:1]
      end-point address of confd service.

  - profile [value type: string]
      configuration profile used while fetching configuration data from confd.

  - fid_start [value type: uint32_t, default: 4]
      TEMPORARY option.
      Client allocates fid for a file during its creation. It assigns
      <0, $fid_start> for first file, <0, $fid_start+1> for second
      and so on.
      mdstore uses constant fid - M0_MDSERVICE_SLASH_FID <1, 65535>
      for namespace root exposed to user.

      Fids below 65535 are reserved for special objects such as: storage root,
      ".motr", ".motr/fid" and potentially many others that will live in ".motr"
      directory.

      Hence fid_start must be greater than 65535.

   'device' argument of mount command is ignored.

   m0t1fs supports following operations:
   - Creating a regular file
   - Remove a regular file
   - Listing files in root directory
   - file read/write of full-stripe width

   @section m0t1fslogspec Logical Specification

   <B>mount/unmount:</B>

   m0t1fs establishes rpc-connections and rpc-sessions with all the services
   obtained from configuration data. If multiple services have same end-point
   address, separate rpc-connection is established with each service i.e.
   if N services have same end-point address, there will be N rpc-connections
   leading to same target end-point.

   The rpc-connections and rpc-sessions will be terminated at unmount time.

   <B> Pools and Pool versions: </B>

   m0t1fs can work with multiple pools and pool versions.
   A pool version comprises of a set of services and devices attached to them.
   Layout and pool machine are associated with the pool version. Pool version
   creates a device to io service map during initialisation.

   m0t1fs finds a valid pool and pool version to start with which has no devices
   from the failure set during mount. Once pool version is obtained, if its
   corresponding pool already exist them the pool version is added to it else
   new pool is initialised.

   <B> Containers and component objects: </B>

   An io service provides access to storage objects, md service provides
   access to md objects and rm service provides access to resources.
   Containers are used to migrate and locate object. Each container is
   identified by container-id. Storage objects and md objects are identified
   by fid which is a pair <container-id, key>. All objects belonging to same
   container have same value for fid.container_id which is equal to id of that
   container.

   "Container location map" maps container-id to service.

   Even if containers are not yet implemented, notion of container id
   is required, to be able to locate a service serving some object
   identified by fid.

   Currently m0t1fs implements simple (and temporary) mechanism to
   build container location map. Number of containers is equal to
   P + 2, where P is pool width and additional 2 containers are used by
   meta-data and resource management.
   Pool width is a file-system parameter, obtained from configuration.

   Assume a user-visible file F. A gob representing F is assigned fid
   <0, K>, where K is taken from a monotonically increasing counter
   (m0t1fs_sb::csb_next_key). Container-id 0 is mapped to md-service,
   by container location map. Container-id `P+2' is mapped to rm-service.

   There are P number of component objects of file F, having fids
   { <i, K> | i = 1, 2..., P}. Here P is equal to pool_width mount option.
   Mapping from <gob_fid, cob_index> -> cob_fid is implemented using
   linear enumeration (B * x + A) with both A and B parameters set to 1.
   Container location map, maps container-ids from 1 to P, to io-services.

   Container location map is populated at mount time and is a part of
   a pool version.

   <B> Directory Operations: </B>

   To create a regular file, m0t1fs sends cob create requests to mds
   (for global object aka gob) and io-service (for component
   objects). Because, mds is not yet implemented, m0t1fs does not send
   cob create request to any mds.  Instead all directory entries are
   maintained in an in-memory list in root inode itself.

   If component object creation fails, m0t1fs does not attempt to
   cleanup component objects that were successfully created. This
   should be handled by dtm component, which is not yet implemented.

   <B> Read/Write: </B>

   m0t1fs currently supports only full stripe IO
   i.e. (iosize % (nr_data_units * stripe_unit_size) == 0)

   read-write operations on file are not synchronised.

   m0t1fs does not cache any data.

   For simplicity, m0t1fs does synchronous rpc with io-services, to
   read/write component objects.

/**
  @section m0t1fs-metadata Metadata

  @section m0t1fs-metadata-rq Requirements

  The following requirements should be met:

  - @b R.DLD.MDSERVICE - all md operations implemented by m0t1fs
  should talk to mdservice in order to provide required functionality. In
  other words they should not generate hardcoded attributes locally on client
  and cache in inode/dentry cache. Required functionality here - is to provide
  mounts persistence.

  - @b R.DLD.POSIX - implemented operations should conform to POSIX
 */

/**
  @section Overview

  The main direction of this work (@ref m0t1fs-metadata-rq) is mostly to follow
  normal linux filesystem driver requirements as for the number and meaning of
  operations handled by the driver.

  This means number of things as follows bellow:

  - the fops presented below, correspond to the usual operations implemented
  by filesystem driver, such as link, unlink, create, etc;
  - mdservice on server side is connected by m0t1fs at mount time. Root inode
  attributes and (optionally) filesystem information, such as free blocks, etc.,
  that is usually needed by statfs, can be retrieved by m0t1fs from mount fop
  response;
  - inode attributes may also contain some information needed to perform I/O
  (layout) and this data may be sent to client as part of getattr fop.

  Fops defined by mdservice are described at @ref mdservice-fops-definition
  In this work we use only some of them in order to provide persistence
  between mounts.

  They are the following:
  - m0_fop_create and m0_fop_create_rep
  - m0_fop_unlink and m0_fop_unlink_rep
  - m0_fop_setattr and m0_fop_setattr_rep
  - m0_fop_getattr and m0_fop_getattr_rep

  @section m0t1fs-metadata-fs Detailed Functional Specification

  Some functions will see modifications in order to implement the
  client-server communication and not just create all metadata in
  memory.

  Only minimal set of operations is needed to support persitency
  between mounts.

  In order to implement mount persistency functionality, the following
  functionality should be implemented:

  - get mdservice volume information enough for statfs and get root
  fid at mount time
  - no hierarchy is needed, that is, no directories support will be
  added in this work
  - list of regular files in root directory should be supported
  - operations with regular files should be supported

  @section Initialization

  m0t1fs_init() - m0_mdservice_fop_init() is added to initialize md
  operations fops.

  m0t1fs_fini() - m0_mdservice_fop_fini() is added to finalize md
  operations fops.

  m0t1fs_fill_super() -> m0t1fs_connect_to_services() - will have also
  to connect the mdservice.

  It also may have some fields from space csb->csb_* initialized
  not from mount options but rather from connect reply information.

  m0t1fs_kill_sb() -> m0t1fs_disconnect_from_services() - will have
  also to disconnect from mdservice.

  @section Inode operations

  m0t1fs_mknod() - is to be added to m0t1fs_dir_inode_operations.
  This is one of variants of create fop.

  m0t1fs_create() - sending create fop is added. Layout speicified
  with mount options or obtained in mount time is to be packed into
  create fop and sent to the server. Errors should be handled on
  all stages.

  m0t1fs_lookup() - sending getattr/lookup fop is added. Errors are
  handled.

  m0t1fs_unlink() - sending unlink fop is added. Errors are handled
  (not needed for this work).

  m0t1fs_link() - is to be added to m0t1fs_dir_inode_operations.
  This is normal hard-link create function that sends link fop to
  mdservice (not needed for this work).

  m0t1fs_mkdir() - is to be added to m0t1fs_dir_inode_operations.
  This function sends create fop initialized in slightly different
  way than for creating regular file (not needed for this work).

  m0t1fs_rmdir() - is to be added to m0t1fs_dir_inode_operations.
  This function sends unlink fop (not needed for this work).

  m0t1fs_symlink() - is to be added to m0t1fs_dir_inode_operations.
  This function sends create fop with mode initialized for symlinks
  (not needed for this work).

  m0t1fs_rename() - is to be added to m0t1fs_dir_inode_operations.
  This function sends rename fop (not needed for this work).

  m0t1fs_setattr() - is to be added to m0t1fs_dir_inode_operations
  and m0t1fs_special_inode_operations. This function sends setattr
  fop.

  m0t1fs_getattr() - is to be added to m0t1fs_dir_inode_operations
  and m0t1fs_special_inode_operations. This function sends getattr
  fop and returns server side inode attributes.

  m0t1fs_permission() - is to be added to m0t1fs_dir_inode_operations
  and m0t1fs_special_inode_operations (not needed for this work).

  The following extended attributes operations to be added. We need
  them in order to run lustre on top of motr.

  m0t1fs_setxattr() - is to be added to m0t1fs_dir_inode_operations
  and m0t1fs_special_inode_operations (not needed for this work).

  m0t1fs_getxattr() - is to be added to m0t1fs_dir_inode_operations
  and m0t1fs_special_inode_operations (not needed for this work).

  m0t1fs_listxattr() - is to be added to m0t1fs_dir_inode_operations
  and m0t1fs_special_inode_operations (not needed for this work).

  m0t1fs_removexattr() - is to be added to m0t1fs_dir_inode_operations
  and m0t1fs_special_inode_operations (not needed for this work).

  Mdservice does not support xattrs fop operations yet. We will add them
  later as part of xattr support work.

  @section File operations

  m0t1fs_open() - is to be added to m0t1fs_dir_file_operations and
  m0t1fs_reg_file_operations.

  This function sends open fop and handles reply and errors in a
  standard way.

  m0t1fs_release() - is to be added to m0t1fs_dir_file_operations and
  m0t1fs_reg_file_operations.

  This function sends close fop on last release call.

  m0t1fs_readdir() - sending readdir and/or getpage fop is added.
  Errors handling and page cache management code should be added.

  @sections Misc changes

  fid_hash() - hash should be generated including ->f_container
  and f_key. This can be used for generating inode numbers in future.
  Still, changing inode numbers allocation is out of scope of this work.

  - @ref m0t1fs-metadata-rq

  All the fs callback functions, implemented in m0t1fs filesystem driver,
  are to be backed with corresponding fop request communicating mdservice

 */

/**
  @section m0t1fs-metadata-cf Conformance

  - @b R.DLD.MDSERVICE - Add support of meta-data operations (above) to m0t1fs.
  Implement a set of fops to be used for communicating meta-data operations
  between m0t1fs and mdservice.

  - @b R.DLD.POSIX - following standard linux fs driver callback functions
  and reqs guarantees basic POSIX conformance. More fine-graned conformance
  may be met with using "standard" test suites for file sytems, such as dbench,
  which is mentioned in Testing section (@ref m0t1fs-metadata-ts). This will
  not be applied in current work as only miimal set of operations will be
  implemented to support between mounts persistence.
 */

/**
  @section m0t1fs-metadata-ts Testing

  In principle full featured m0t1fs should pass standard fs tests such as
  dbench as part of integration testing. This work scope testing will cover
  the basic functionality that includes mount, create files, re-mount and check
  if files exist and have the same attributes as before re-mount.

  As for unit testing, that may run on "before-commit" basis,  small and fast
  set of basic fs operations (10-20 operations) can be added to standard UT
  framework.

 */

/**
  @section m0t1fs-metadata-dp Dependencies

  - layout. It would be good to have layout functionality in place but without
  it most of work also can be done.
  - recovery. Recovery principles better to be ready to finish this work. Some
  tests may load client node so much that connection problems can occur.

 * @section Motr-CMD-ovw Overview
 * This document contains the high level and detailed level design for the Motr
 * Clustered Meta-data (a.k.a CMD).
 *
 * More than a single meta-data server will be supported in Motr CMD, scattering
 * meta-data and meta-data operations across all Motr server nodes. Multiple
 * mdservices will be running in a Motr system.
 *
 * These mdservices are share-nothing: each is completely independent from
 * others and manages its own isolated subset of global objects. Each mdservice
 * has a full set of md tables: namespace, object index, layout, omg, fab, etc.
 * The only resource shared by mdservices is fid name space.
 * The same as current implementation, Motr client will continue to have all
 * its objects created in a single root directory. In Active-Archive product
 * (AA), file names of objects in root directory are uniform: some kind
 * of oostore-generated identifiers is used as its file name.
 *
 * @section Motr-CMD-def Definitions
 *  - CMD: Clustered Meta-data. With CMD, meta-data of Motr is stored across
 *         multiple mdservices. Meta-data operations are handled by these
 *         mdservices. Meta-data operations go to proper mdservice on which
 *         the related meta-data is stored.
 *  - AA:  Active Archive. Motr client is used in some archive system. Objects
 *         from archive system are stored in Motr client as a file in root
 *         directory.
 *  - FID: File IDentification. FID is used to identify an object uniquely in
 *         Motr.
 *  - confc/confd: Motr configuration client and configuration daemon.
 *         Motr configuration is system information about how a Motr system
 *         is configured. This information is used to configure and start
 *         various Motr services, networks, transports, clients, etc.
 *
 * @section Motr-CMD-req Requirements
 * The specified requirements are as follows:
 * - R.CMD: Motr system may run mdservices on multiple server nodes. Motr
 *          meta-data are stored across all these mdservices. Motr meta-data
 *          services are handled by these mdservices.
 * - R.CMD.share-0: These mdservices are independent from each other. Nothing
 *                  is shared among them, except that FID namespace is
 *                  distributed among all mdservices.
 * - R.CMD.conf: The configuration of mdservices is managed by confd. A Motr
 *               client gets this configuration by confc.
 * - R.CMD.namespace: Objects (files) are all stored root directory. A Motr
 *                    client gets a full list of all objects in root directory
 *                    from all mdservices.
 * - R.CMD.code-reuse: The code to read root directory should be structured
 *                     so that it can be re-used to support striping in
 *                     non-root directory easily.
 * - R.CMD.oostore: A oostore mode for motr client is needed. In this mode,
 *                   some oostore creates files in root directory. File name
 *                   is its FID.
 * - R.CMD.FID: Treat FID as a resource. FID is allocated by RM service, and fid
 *              to mdservice mapping is also managed by RM service.
 *
 * @section Motr-CMD-depends Dependency
 * This feature has no dependency on others right now.
 *
 *
 * @section Motr-CMD-highlights Highlights
 * N/A
 *
 * @section Motr-CMD-fspec Functional Specification
 * To achieve the requirements in @ref Motr-CMD-req step by step, the CMD
 * implementation will be divided into several stages.
 *
 * - Stage 0: At this first stage, the number of mdservices and its
 *            configuration are fixed when system is initialised and cannot be
 *            changed afterwords. No new mdservices can be added. If a
 *            mdservice fails completely, the global objects it manages become
 *            unaccessible. The list of mdservices is given by confd;
 *            Mount option, fid_start, is still given to client. We still assume
 *            unique fids are generated by clients.
 *            An algorithm will be used to map a fid to mdservice. So Motr client
 *            can talk to the right mdservice when creating, reading, writing
 *            files, and other meta-data operations.
 * - Stage OOSTORE: In this stage, A special m0t1fs mode (specified via a mount
 *                   option) is added, specifically designed to work with
 *                   oostore. In this mode, file name is a fid. Only names of
 *                   the form recognised by m0_fid_sscanf() are allowed in the
 *                   root directory. When a file with the name "C:K" is created,
 *                   its fid is taken to be C:K. This makes "start_fid" option
 *                   unnecessary.
 * - Stage RM-CLIENT: In this stage, Motr clients start using RM for fid
 *                    allocation. There is a special single instance of RM
 *                    service, that manages the entire fid name-space
 *                    (0, 0)---(~0ULL, ~0ULL). Motr clients request ranges of
 *                    fids from the service and use them for allocation of fid.
 * - Stage RM-SERVICE: In this stage, we add support for adding more mdservices
 *                     at runtime. There is a special instance of RM service
 *                     (different from one in RM-CLIENT) which manages the
 *                     ranges of fids assigned to services. An mdservice gets
 *                     range of fids from RM. Clients get the entire
 *                     {fid_range -> mdservice} list from RM and use it to map
 *                     fids to services. In addition each mdservice keeps record
 *                     of fids actually used by existing files (this range can
 *                     be calculated from object index table). When a new
 *                     service is added, it asks RM for a new range. RM requests
 *                     existing mdservices to cancel their fid regions and
 *                     mdservices cancel some *unused* ranges, that is ranges
 *                     of fids for which there are no existing files. The new
 *                     service gets the union of these ranges.
 *
 * For AA alpha, we will only implement stage 0 and stage OOSTORE.
 *
 * @section Motr-CMD-lspec Logical Specification
 * For stage 0 and stage OOSTORE, a simple data structure and a simple
 * algorithm will be used to map an object and its operations to the right
 * mdservice. Motr client has a "struct m0_reqh_service_ctx" for every
 * service, including mdservice, ioservice, and other service. These service
 * contexts are linked in a list. We will also use an array to store all the
 * pointers to these mds contexts.
 * @code
 *	struct m0_reqh_service_ctx *mds_map[M0T1FS_MAX_MDS_NR];
 * #endofcode
 * A simple function is used to map a file to mdservice by hashing its file
 * name:
 * @code
 *        mdservice_idx = hash(filename) % mdservice_nr;
 * @endofcode
 * The mdservice_idx is the index in array mds_map. Thus, the operations on this
 * file will find the right mdservice to go for. Currently, rename operation
 * is not supported in Motr. Link operation will be disabled after this
 * feature is landned.
 *
 * The m0t1fs_readdir() will be modified to read directory entries from all
 * mdservices (or a sub-set of all, like a pool). READDIR requests will be sent
 * to these mdservices and EOF (end of file) will be set when all mdservices
 * have been iterated. This is like the root directory splits into all
 * mdservices. A mdservice index will be added into "struct m0t1fs_filedata" to
 * indicate the current mdservice that readdir() position is at.
 * @code
 *        struct m0t1fs_filedata {

 *
 * In normal mode, FID of new file is allocated by client. The mount option
 * fid_start helps client to generate unique FID. There will be a special and
 * temporary mode, OOSTORE mode of Motr client, and in this mode the FID of
 * new file is taken from the file name. (After stage RM-CLIENT, fid will be
 * managed by RM service.) File name of a new file is anything that
 * m0_fid_sscanf() can understand. FID of new file is taken from that.
 *
 * @todo Design for RM-CLIENT and RM-SERVER will be added later.
 *
 * @subsection Motr-CMD-lspec-schema Schema
 * Configuration of multiple mdservices is managed by confd, and provided to
 * Motr client via confc. The schema for mdservice is similar to that for
 * ioservice. Motr client startup code will parse this configuration and setup
 * mdservice and mapping array.
 *
 * @section Motr-CMD-conformance Conformance
 * - I.CMD: Multiple mdservices can be started in a Motr system, and clients
 *          can connect to these mdservices. Motr clients map objects to proper
 *          mdservice. Meta-data operations go to the right mdservice.
 * - I.CMD.share: Motr mdservice shares nothing, and is independent.
 * - I.CMD.conf: The configuration of mdservices is managed by confd. The
 *   		 mdservice schema is similar to that of ioservice. Motr clients
 *   		 get mdservice configuration from confd via confc.
 * - I.CMD.namespace: All objects are stored in root directory. Listing of root
 *                    directory from client will readdir() from all mdservices
 *                    and form a global name space.
 * - I.CMD.code-reuse: No particular workaround is used to gather the directory
 *                     entries for root dir. All code will be reusable for
 *                     non-root directory.
 * - I.CMD.oostore: A oostore mode for motr client is added. In this mode,
 *                   File name is a FID, the format of "C:K". FID of new file
 *                   is taken from its name.
 * - I.CMD.FID: @todo This will be implemented in RM-CLIENT and RM-SERVER stage.
 *
 * @section Motr-CMD-ut Unit Tests
 * Existing unit test are still valid and useful. The following unit tests are
 * added to verify new functionalities.
 *
 * Unit Test 1: Good configuration for mdservice. Motr client starts correctly.
 * Unit Test 2: Invalid configurations for mdservice. Motr client reports error
 *              and failed to start.
 * Unit Test 3: Different FID maps to correct mdservice index. mdservices are
 *              always in valid range.
 * Unit Test 4: readdir() can switch from one mds to another mds, and finally
 *              iterate all mdservice.
 * Unit Test 5: In OOSTORE mode, FID can be parsed from new file with valid
 *              file name.
 * Unit Test 6: In OOSTORE mode, FID cannot be parsed from new file with
 *              invalid file name, and error is reported.
 *
 * @section Motr-CMD-st System Tests
 * The following new system tests will be added.
 * System Test 1: Some files are created in root dir and readdir() will get a
 *                full list of these files without error.
 * System Test 2: Multiple mdservices are configured in confd, and Motr clients
 *                can start up correctly.
