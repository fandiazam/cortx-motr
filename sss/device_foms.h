  @section DLD-sss_device-fspec Functional Specification
  Device commands provides control of individual devices like attach, detach and
  format using directly creation/deletion stob and stob domain and pool events.

   Generic TX fom phases start TX transaction. Its interfere to create and
   finalize AD stob domain. Work with AD stob domain made a separate stage.
   For work with AD stob domain need to get additional data. Read them from
   confc subsystem move to first stage too.
   Both stages can to diagnose error and can go to Failure phase.
   Fom phase SSS_DFOM_SWITCH switch to next dependence Device command ID and
   current stage.

   First stage - before TX generic fom phases:
   - initiate fom - check device by disk fid, read additional data: cid,
   storage device fid from confc
   - work with AD stob domain and stob

   Second stage - after TX generic fom phases:
   - work with Pool machine and Pool events

  @subsection DLD-sss_device-fspec-ds Data Structures
  - m0_sss_device_fom
    Represents fom with additional fields describing device such as index in
    pool machine table, cid, storage device fid and current stage of command.

  @subsection DLD-sss_device-fspec-usecases-attach Device attach command
    Create AD stob domain and main stob for device and start pool event with
    change device status on online.

  @subsection DLD-sss_device-fspec-usecases-detach Device detach command
    Finalization AD stob domain and main stob for device and start pool event
    with change device status on offline.
    Note! Finalization of stob domain is not equal to its destruction.
          Finalization does not delete stob's meta-data in BE.
