/**
 * @defgroup ha High availability
 *
 * HA epoch module.
 *
 * High-availability (HA) sub-system defines "an HA epoch" as a maximal interval
 * in the system history through which no failures are agreed upon.
 *
 * (Note that the word "epoch" has other meanings.)
 *
 * When a new failure is detected or previous failure eliminated, the process of
 * developing a consensus about the change in failure state is initiated within
 * the HA sub-system. This process, if successful, culminates in transition to a
 * new epoch.
 *
 * An epoch is identified by "an epoch number", which is a 64-bit integer. A
 * later epoch has greater number.
 *
 * Motr operations that depend on failures are tagged by epoch
 * numbers. Typically, rpc items, sent as part of an operation, carry as a field
 * the number of the epoch in which the operation was initiated. If receiver
 * receives a message from an epoch different from the epoch known to the
 * receiver, it has to handle it specially. Possible options include:
 *
 *     - ignore the epoch number difference and process the operation as usual,
 *
 *     - move the receiver to the item's epoch (this is only possible if the
 *       item's epoch is greater than the receiver epoch, because epoch numbers
 *       must increase monotonically),
 *
 *     - drop the item on the floor,
 *
 *     - send "wrong epoch" reply to the sender.
 *
 * HA notifies the system about transition to the new epoch by broadcasting
 * special item to all nodes. This item is always processed by moving its
 * receivers to the item's epoch.
