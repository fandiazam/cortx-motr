 * - TODO 2 cases TRANSIENT -> ONLINE: if m0d reconnected or it's restarted
 * - TODO can m0d receive TRANSIENT or FAILED about itself
 * - TODO race between FAILED about process and systemd restart
 * - TODO check types of process fid
 *
 * State transition rules
 *
 * I. Processes and Services
 *
 * I.a Process and Service States
 * 1. There are 3 process/service states: FAILED, TRANSIENT and ONLINE.
 * 2. The only allowed state transitions for processes/services are
 *    FAILED <-> TRANSIENT <-> ONLINE, ONLINE -> FAILED.
 * 3. At the start every process/service is in FAILED state.
 * 4. When process/service starts it's moved to TRANSIENT state and then to
 *    ONLINE state.
 * 5. When there are signs that process/service is not ONLINE then it's moved to
 *    TRANSIENT state.
 * 6. When the decision is made that process/service is dead it's moved to
 *    FAILED state.
 * 7. When a process is permanently removed from the cluster it's going to
 *    FAILED state before it's removed from the configuration.
 *
 * I.b Events
 * 1. Processes and services send event messages when they are starting and
 *    stopping.
 * 2. Before process/service is started it sends STARTING event.
 * 3. After process/service is started it sends STARTED event.
 * 4. Before process/service initiates stop sequence it sends STOPPING event.
 * 5. After process/service initiates stop sequence it sends STOPPED event.
 * 6. Events for the same process/service are always sent in the same order:
 *    STARTING -> STARTED -> STOPPING -> STOPPED.
 *
 * I.c Correlation between events and states
 *
 * 1. Before process/service is started it should be in FAILED state.
 * 2. If process/service dies it's moved to FAILED state.
 * 3. After <...> event is sent the process/service is moved to <...> state:
 *    STARTING - TRANSIENT
 *    STARTED  - ONLINE
 *    STOPPING - TRANSIENT
 *    STOPPED  - FAILED.
 *
 * I.d Use cases
 * 1. Process/service start
 *            STARTING              STARTED
 *    FAILED ----------> TRANSIENT --------> ONLINE
 * 2. Process/service stop
 *               STOPPING             STOPPED
 *    ONLINE ------------> TRANSIENT ----------> FAILED
 * 3. Process/service crash
 *            the decision has been made
 *            that the process crashed
 *    ONLINE ----------------------------> FAILED
 * 4. Temporary process/service timeout
 *             decision that process             decision that process
 *                 may be dead                         is alive
 *    ONLINE -----------------------> TRANSIENT -----------------------> ONLINE
 * 5. Permanent process/servise timeout
 *             decision that process             decision that process
 *                 may be dead                          is dead
 *    ONLINE -----------------------> TRANSIENT -----------------------> FAILED
 *
 * I.e Handling process/service state transitions in rpc
 * 1. If a process/service is ONLINE the connect timeout is M0_TIME_NEVER and
 *    the number of resends is unlimited.
 * 2. If a process/service is in TRANSIENT state the connect timeout and the
 *    number of resends are limited.
 * 3. If a process/service is in FAILED state then no attempt is made to
 *    communicate with the process/service and all existing rpc
 *    sessions/connections are dropped without timeout.
 *
 * Reconnect protocol
 *
 * - Legend
 *   - HA1 - side with outgoging link (m0_ha with HA link from connect());
 *   - HA2 - side with incoming link (m0_ha with HA link from entrypoint
 *     server);
 *   - Cx - case #x
 *   - Sx - step #x
 *   - CxSy - case #x, step #y
 * - C1 HA2 is started, HA1 starts (first start after HA2 had started):
 *   - S1 HA1 sends entrypoint request with first_request flag set
 *   - S2 HA2 receives the request
 *   - S3 HA2 looks at the flag and makes new HA link
 *   - S4 HA2 sends entrypoint reply
 *   - S5 HA1 makes new link with the parameters from reply
 * - C2 HA1 and HA2 restart
 *   - the same as C1
 * - C3 HA1 restarts, HA2 is alive
 *   - the same as C1. Existing link is totally ignored in C1S3
 * - C4 HA2 restarts, HA1 is alive
 *   - S1 HA1 considers HA2 dead
 *   - S2 HA1 starts HA link reconnect
 *   - S3 HA1 tries to send entrypoint request to HA2 in infinite loop
 *   - S4 HA1 sends entrypoint request
 *   - S5 HA2 receives entrypoint request
 *   - S7 HA2 sees first_request flag is not set
 *   - S8 HA2 makes HA link with parameters from request
 *   - S9 HA2 sends entrypoint reply
 *   - S10 HA1 ends HA link reconnect
 * - C5 HA1 is alive, HA2 is alive, HA2 considers HA1 dead due to transient
 *   network failure
 *   - S1 C4S1, C4S2, C4S3
 *   - S2 HA2 terminates the process with HA1
 *   - S3 HA2 ensures that process is terminated
 *   - S4 C3
 *
 * Source structure
 * - ha/entrypoint_fops.h - entrypoint fops + req <-> req_fop, rep <-> rep_fop
 * - ha/entrypoint.h      - entrypoint client & server (transport)
 *
 * entrypoint request handling
 * - func Motr send entrypoint request

 * - cb   HA   accept incoming connection
 * - func Motr disconnect from HA
