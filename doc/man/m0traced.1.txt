NAME
----
m0traced - daemon, which polls trace buffer of m0tr.ko or m0d and saves trace
records into continuous trace file


SYNOPSIS
--------
*m0traced* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Daemon, which polls trace buffer of *m0tr.ko* or *m0d* and saves trace records
in binary format into continuous trace file for postmortem analysis by
*m0tracedump* and *m0trace* utilities. It supports log rotation when log size
reaches some threshold.

OPTIONS
-------
*-i* 'IN_FILE'::
    Input file name, if none is provided, then `/sys/kernel/debug/motr/trace/buffer`
    is used by default.

*-o* 'OUT_FILE'::
    Output file name, if none is provided, then `/var/log/motr/m0trace.bin` is
    used by default.

*-O* 'OUT_FILE'::
    Output file name for m0tr.ko core image, if none is provided, then
    `/var/log/motr/m0tr_ko.img` is used by default. This option is in effect
    only together with `-K` option.

*-d*::
    Daemon mode (run in the background, log errors into syslog).

*-K*::
    Save m0tr.ko core image into a file, specified by `-O` option. This option
    has no effect, as it's 'on' by default. It has been kept for backward
    compatibility. It's superseded by `-S` option.

*-S*::
    Discards action of `-K` option, i.e. don't save m0tr.ko core image into a
    file.

*-l*::
    Log level number (from syslog.h).

*-L*::
    Log information into syslog instead of STDOUT (by default is off).

*-s*::
    Size of output trace file in MB, when it's reached, log rotation is
    performed; if set to 0 then rotation is disabled, default is 1024MB.

*-k*::
    Number of logs to keep in log rotation, default is 6.

*-m*::
    Monitor trace buffer file creation each second during specified period of
    time (in seconds).

*-h, --help*::
    Display help screen and exit.


EXAMPLES
--------
Run *m0traced* with default settings:

  $ m0traced

Run as daemon and save traces of *m0d* process with PID 33972:

  $ m0traced -d -i /var/run/motr/m0trace.33972 -o /var/log/motr/m0trace.33972.bin
