NAME
----
m0tracedump - utility to convert binary trace logs to YAML format for further
analysis by m0trace(1)


SYNOPSIS
--------
*m0tracedump* ['OPTIONS']


OPTIONS
-------
*-i* 'IN_FILE'::
    Input file name, if none is provided, then STDIN is used by default.

*-o* 'OUT_FILE'::
    Output file name, if none is provided, then STDOUT is used by default.

*-s*::
    Enable stream mode - each trace record is formatted as a separate YAML
    document, so they can be fetched from YAML stream one by one. This allows
    *m0trace* to process each record one by one "on the fly" w/o the need to
    load a whole YAML document first, which also reduce memory footprint. It's
    off by default.

*-H*::
    Dump only trace header information from trace log.

*-k*::
    Path to m0tr.ko modules's core image (only required for parsing kernel
    mode trace files), by default it is '/var/log/motr/m0tr_ko.img'.

*-h, --help*::
    Display help screen and exit.


EXAMPLES
--------
  $ m0tracedump -i /var/run/motr/m0trace.33972 -o /var/log/motr/m0trace.33972.yml

  $ m0tracedump -i /var/run/motr/m0trace.33972 | gzip -c > /var/log/motr/m0trace.33972.yml.gz
