   @defgroup chan Waiting channels

   Waiting channel.

   A channel (m0_chan) is a stream of asynchronous events that a channel user
   can wait or register a call-back for.

   A clink (m0_clink) is a record of interest in events on a particular
   channel. A user adds a clink to a channel and appearance of new events in
   the stream is recorded in the clink.

   There are two interfaces related to channels:

       - producer interface. It consists of m0_chan_signal(), m0_clink_signal()
         and m0_chan_broadcast() functions. These functions are called to
         declare that new asynchronous event happened in the stream.

       - consumer interface. It consists of m0_clink_add(), m0_clink_del(),
         m0_chan_wait() and m0_chan_trywait() functions.

   When a producer declares an event on a channel, this event is delivered. If
   event is a broadcast (m0_chan_broadcast()) it is delivered to all clinks
   registered with the channel. If event is a signal (m0_chan_signal()) it is
   delivered to a single clink (if any) registered with the channel. Clinks for
   delivery of consecutive signals are selected in a round-robin manner.

   A special m0_clink_signal() function is provided to signal a particular
   clink. m0_clink_signal() delivers a signal to its argument clink. This
   function does not take any locks and is designed to be used in "awkward"
   contexts, like interrupt handler or timer call-backs, where blocking on a
   lock is not allowed. Use sparingly.

   The method of delivery depends on the clink interface used (m0_clink). If
   clink has a call-back, the delivery starts with calling this call-back. If a
   clink has no call-back or the call-back returns false, the delivered event
   becomes pending on the clink. Pending events can be consumed by calls to
   m0_chan_wait(), m0_chan_timedwait() and m0_chan_trywait().

   <b>Filtered wake-ups.</b>

   By returning true from a call-back, it is possible to "filter" some events
   out and avoid potentially expensive thread wake-up. A typical use case for
   this is the following:

   @code
   struct wait_state {
           struct m0_clink f_clink;
	   ...
   };

   static bool callback(struct m0_clink *clink)
   {
           struct wait_state *f =
                   container_of(clink, struct wait_state, f_clink);
	   return !condition_is_right(f);
   }

   {
           struct wait_state g;

	   m0_clink_init(&g.f_clink, &callback);
	   m0_clink_add(chan, &g.f_clink);
	   ...
	   while (!condition_is_right(&g)) {
	           m0_chan_wait(&g.f_clink);
	   }
   }
   @endcode

   The idea behind this idiom is that the call-back is called in the same
   context where the event is declared and it is much cheaper to test whether a
   condition is right than to wake up a waiting thread that would check this
   and go back to sleep if it is not.

   <b>Multiple channels.</b>

   It is possible to wait for an event to be announced on a channel from a
   set. To this end, first a clink is created as usual. Then, additional
   (unintialised) clinks are attached to the first by a call to
   m0_clink_attach(), forming a "clink group" consisting of the original clink
   and all clinks attached. Clinks from the group can be registered with
   multiple (or the same) channels. Events announced on any channel are
   delivered to all clinks in the group.

   Groups are used as following:

       - initialise a "group head" clink;

       - attach other clinks to the group, without initialising them;

       - register the group clinks with their channels, starting with the head;

       - to wait for an event on any channel, wait on the group head.

       - call-backs can be used for event filtering on any channel as usual;

       - de-register the clinks, head last.

   @code
   struct m0_clink cl0;
   struct m0_clink cl1;

   m0_clink_init(&cl0, call_back0);
   m0_clink_attach(&cl1, &cl0, call_back1);

   m0_clink_add(chan0, &cl0);
   m0_clink_add(chan1, &cl1);

   // wait for an event on chan0 or chan1
   m0_chan_wait(&cl0);

   // de-register clinks, head last
   m0_clink_del(&cl1);
   m0_clink_del(&cl0);

   // finalise in any order
   m0_clink_fini(&cl0);
   m0_clink_fini(&cl1);
   @endcode

   @note An interface similar to m0_chan was a part of historical UNIX kernel
   implementations. It is where "CHAN" field in ps(1) output comes from.

   @todo The next scalability improvement is to allow m0_chan to use an
   externally specified mutex instead of a built-in one. This would allow
   larger state machines with multiple channels to operate under fewer locks,
   reducing coherency bus traffic.

   <b>Concurrency control</b>

   There are three groups of channel functions with different serialization
   requirements:

   - (A) caller holds the ch_guard lock:

          m0_clink_add(),
          m0_clink_del(),
          m0_chan_signal(),
          m0_chan_broadcast(),
          m0_chan_fini();

         The implementation checks that the channel lock is held.

   - (B) caller does not hold the ch_guard lock:

          m0_clink_add_lock(),
          m0_clink_del_lock(),
          m0_chan_signal_lock(),
          m0_chan_broadcast_lock(),
          m0_chan_fini_lock();

         The implementation checks that the channel lock is not held.

   - (C) caller may hold the ch_guard lock:

          m0_clink_init(),
          m0_clink_fini(),
          m0_clink_attach(),
          m0_clink_is_armed(),
          m0_clink_signal() (note this lock-tolerant signalling facility!),
          m0_chan_init(),
          m0_chan_wait(),
          m0_chan_trywait(),
          m0_chan_timedwait().

         Nothing is assumed by the implementation about the channel lock.

   <b>Liveness</b>

   A user has to enforce a serialization between event production and channel
   destruction.

/**
   A record of interest in events on a stream.

   A clink records the appearance of events in the stream.

   There are two ways to use a clink:

   @li an asynchronous call-back can be specified as an argument to clink
   constructor m0_clink_init(). This call-back is called when an event happens
   in the channel the clink is registered with. It is guaranteed that
   a call-back is executed in the same context where event producer declared
   new event. A per-channel mutex m0_chan::ch_guard is held while call-backs
   are executed (except the case when m0_clink_signal() is used by producer).

   @li once a clink is registered with a channel, it is possible to wait until
   an event happens by calling m0_chan_wait().

   See the "Filtered wake-ups" section in the top-level comment on how to
   combine call-backs with waiting.

   <b>Concurrency control</b>

   A user must guarantee that at most one thread waits on a
   clink. Synchronization between call-backs, waits and clink destruction is
   also up to user.

   A user owns a clink before call to m0_clink_add() and after return from the
   m0_clink_del() call. At any other time clink can be concurrently accessed by
   the implementation.

   <b>Liveness</b>

   A user is free to dispose a clink whenever it owns the latter.
