/**
   @defgroup timer Generic timer manipulation

   Any timer should call m0_timer_init() function before any function. That
   init function does all initialization for this timer. After that, the
   m0_timer_start() function is called to start the timer. The timer callback
   function will be called repeatedly, if this is a repeatable timer. Function
   m0_timer_stop() is used to stop the timer, and m0_timer_fini() to destroy
   the timer after usage.

   User supplied callback function should be small, run and complete quickly.

   There are two types of timer: soft timer and hard timer. For Linux kernel
   implementation, all timers are hard timer. For userspace implementation,
   soft timer and hard timer have different mechanism:

   - Hard timer has better resolution and is driven by signal. The
     user-defined callback should take short time, should never block
     at any time. Also in user space it should be async-signal-safe
     (see signal(7)), in kernel space it can only take _irq spin-locks.
   - Soft timer creates separate thread to execute the user-defined
     callback for each timer. So the overhead is bigger than hard timer.
     The user-defined callback execution may take longer time and it will
     not impact other timers.

   @endverbatim

   Error handling
   - m0_timer_init() can fail;
   - m0_timer_fini() can't fail;
   - m0_timer_start(), m0_timer_stop() is guaranteed to succeed after
     successful m0_timer_init() call.

   Implementation details
   - POSIX timer is used in hard timer implementation;
   - POSIX timer is created in m0_timer_init() and is deleted in
     m0_timer_fini();
   - m0_thread is used in soft timer implementation;
   - m0_thread is started in m0_timer_init() and is finalised in
     m0_timer_fini();
   - add_timer() is used in kernel timer implementation.

   Limitations
   - Number of hard timers is limited by maximum number of pending signals,
     see `ulimit -i`.
   - Number of soft timers is limited by maximum number of threads.

   @note m0_timer_* functions should not be used in the timer callbacks.
