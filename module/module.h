/**
 * @defgroup module
 *
 * A @em module is part of Motr, which can be initialised or finalised.
 * A module can correspond to a software module (e.g., lib/thread, reqh)
 * or to a run-time entity (reqh instance, service, stob domain, etc.).
 *
 * A module defines an ordered list of @em levels, corresponding to the
 * states of module initialisation. E.g., a reqh instance module might have
 * following levels:
 *
 * 0. m0_reqh structure initialised
 * 1. locality handler threads started
 * 2. BE started
 * 3. layout domain initialised
 * 4. ready to start services
 *
 * With a level are associated entry and exit functions, executed when
 * the level is entered and left.
 *
 * There are @em dependencies between (module, level) pairs.
 * A dependency
 *
 * @verbatim
 *         (m0, l0) -> (m1, l1)
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * means that the module m1 must be at least at the level l1 before the
 * module m0 can enter the level l0. For example there can be a dependency
 *
 * @verbatim
 *         (reqh_instance, locality_handler_threads_started) -> \
 *                 (lib_thread, initialised)
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * specifying that threading subsystem should be initialised before reqh
 * can start threads.
 *
 * It's important to understand that dependencies exist between (module,
 * level) pairs rather than between modules. Because of this, a potential
 * dependency cycle can be broken by introducing an additional level,
 * instead of a more expensive operation of introducing an additional
 * module.
 *
 * The collection of modules is not fixed. An entry function of a module
 * can add more modules and dependencies to the system. For example, one of
 * m0d levels fetches configuration information from confc. The list of
 * services to be run on this m0d is obtained from confc, and modules,
 * corresponding to the services are added, with appropriate dependencies.
 * After this m0d initialisation continues, taking new modules and
 * dependencies into account.
 *
 * Dependencies organize modules in an acyclic graph, which is not
 * necessarily a tree. Flexible initialisation is achieved by adding
 * special nodes in this graph. E.g., a unit test can introduce a module,
 * depending on subsystems that the test needs. To prepare for the test,
 * this module is initialised, starting subsystems. Another well-known
 * nodes in this graph are m0t1fs_instance and m0d_instance: first is a
 * module representing a m0t1fs mount point, depending on all subsystems
 * that m0t1fs needs. The latter represents an m0d process.
 *
 * As an example of a long(ish) chain of dependencies consider:
 *
 * 0. network starts
 * 1. rpc starts
 * 2. reqh starts
 * 3. confc starts
 * 4. reqh connects to confd
 * 5. confc is populated from confd
 * 6. stob identifier of seg0 is obtained from confc
 * 7. BE starts
 * 8. dtm starts
 * 9. reqh starts (other) services
